# Dionne-Fortuin's Portfolio 

## About me
I'm a 27 year old woman who resides in Cape Town, South Africa. On the weekends I love spending time in nature, watching K-drama's and going for long walks with my dog Ruby. I have an unhealthy obsession with curried beans and could possibly eat it for the rest of my life, if I had a choice! In my spare time, I love watching videos on conspiracy theories and slice of life anime. 

## Work experience
In my professional career, I started out as a Linguistics tutor and Research assistant at the University of the Western Cape. Following this, I started working at 2U as a Learning Designer and currently transitioned into the role of a Course Writer. 

## Skills 
I'm skilled at critical analysis of texts and different forms of media, I am a writer and can do some design work on a micro-scale. I know my way around cutting curly hair and am coined by my family and friends as the *curl doctor*!
